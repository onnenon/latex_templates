Our problem was to create a simple program designed to perform statistical
operations. Subdividing the problem into a series of steps, our lab team decided on the
following initial algorithm: \par 
\begin{enumerate}\color{gvblue}
	\item Get the six test scores. 
	\item Compute the average of the scores using the formula (s 1 + s 2 + ... + s 6 )/6.0. 
	\item Display the average. 
\end{enumerate}
In addition, we decided to extend our solution by asking the user to sign in with his or her
initials. Once entered, the program would display his or her initials and ask the user to
enter six separated test scores. Finally the program would calculate the mean of those
scores and print the average to screen. \par
Using the basic outline above, we designed our program in steps. We first began
be selecting the variable data types. All numeric data was assigned to float data types
in order to accurately store decimal numbers in the range of 0 to 100, while initial would
be stored to char types. We next modified our source code to utilize the scanf()
command to process each input variable. To process and ensure proper input data, we
utilized the hints given in the lab instructions.
